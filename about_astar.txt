A* Path Planning Algorithm
---------------------------
A* is a graph traversal and search algorithm. It is widely used for pathfinding and graph traversal.
The algorithm calculates the shortest path between a start node and a goal node.
A* combines the concepts of Dijkstra's algorithm and heuristics for efficient searching.
